## Audit Outcome: âœ… Implementation-Ready (Green)

The document **Epics2\_7\_revised\_detailed.md** fully aligns with **Epics\_Revised\_1.md** in terms of technical completeness, explicitness, acceptance criteria, and operational constraints. Each ticket's context, acceptance criteria, and technical steps correctly reflect the intent and scope of the authoritative source (Epics\_Revised\_1.md). No fatal errors, critical misalignments, or severe risks were identified.

## Patch List (Minor Issues Only)

Below are minor clarifications and editorial corrections recommended before initiating implementation. These do **not** block immediate implementation, but are advised for clarity and maintainability:

1. **API-003**

   * Clearly document in `docs/api/jwt_auth.md` the exact steps for manual rollback using:

     ```bash
     terraform apply -refresh-only -replace=aws_apigatewayv2_route_settings.<resource_name>
     ```

     (Specify the exact Terraform resource names explicitly rather than "replace `.example` with actual resource name".)

2. **API-004**

   * Add the explicit full JSON format to the Terraform snippet for access logging to match acceptance criteria explicitly:

     ```hcl
     access_log_settings {
       destination_arn = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.api_access.arn
       format = jsonencode({
         requestId  = "$context.requestId"
         ip         = "$context.identity.sourceIp"
         route      = "$context.routeKey"
         status     = "$context.status"
         jwtSub     = "$context.authorizer.claims.sub"
         latencyMs  = "$context.responseLatency"
         userAgent  = "$context.identity.userAgent"
       })
     }
     ```

3. **LAM-001**

   * Explicitly define in the acceptance criteria what constitutes "previous 5 versions retained." Clarify if version retention is managed automatically via Terraform/Lambda aliases or through AWS settings manually.

4. **OPS-001**

   * Explicitly define the Terraform resource snippet for the SNS subscriber (currently an implied placeholder). Example:

     ```hcl
     resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "budget_warn_subscriber" {
       topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.tlfif-budget-warn.arn
       protocol  = "email"
       endpoint  = "ops-alert@example.com"
     }
     ```

5. **OPS-003**

   * Add explicitly in the acceptance criteria a mention of the Terraform definition for SNS topic subscription:

     ```hcl
     resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "daily_cost_email_subscriber" {
       topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.tlfif-cost-daily.arn
       protocol  = "email"
       endpoint  = "finance-team@example.com"
     }
     ```

6. **CI-003**

   * Clarify explicitly where and how the JWT token (`CI_TEST_TOKEN`) is stored and rotated, and how rotation is documented/automated (currently briefly noted in technical notes).

## ðŸŸ¢ **Final Verdict:**

**Epics2\_7\_revised\_detailed.md** is confirmed as **ready for implementation**.
The minor patches above are recommended to enhance clarity and maintainability but are not blockers. Implementation can safely commence immediately, with the patches addressed promptly as follow-up documentation refinements.
