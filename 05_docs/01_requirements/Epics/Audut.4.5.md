Exhaustive Audit: Comparison of NewEpics vs. OldEpics


---

Scope and Methodology

Thorough side-by-side comparison between NewEpics (recently created) and OldEpics (previously trusted and refined).

Confirm that NewEpics accurately mirrors OldEpics, except for the intentional substitution of Redis with SQS.

Special focus on ensuring:

Completeness of implementation details.

No placeholders or missing links.

Compliance with rules (no admin privileges, no Docker, cost reduction).




---

‚ë† API EPIC Comparison:

API-003: Gateway Hardening & Per-User Throttling

Assessment:

JWT verification, per-user throttling, immutable route settings, tests, and docs exactly match OldEpics in content and rigor.

Clearly replaces Redis queues (if ever implicitly mentioned in OldEpics) with explicit, clearly defined SQS FIFO queues.

Queue visibility timeout is clearly set (60s), meeting practical requirements.


Potential Issues / Mistakes:

No placeholder detected; configuration snippets are complete.

Integration with API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí SQS is clearly defined and achievable without Docker or admin rights locally (pure AWS managed solution).

Cost impact: Using SQS FIFO queue is significantly cheaper than Redis and eliminates continuous instance cost.


‚úÖ Conclusion: Good quality and accurate replacement.


---

API-004: CORS & Structured JSON Logging

Assessment:

CORS policy, structured logging, retention policies, and smoke tests are identical in both Epics.

No Redis originally referenced, thus minimal changes here.

Added structured logging for SQS messages. Clear log format provided.


Potential Issues / Mistakes:

Logs capturing SQS-specific states ("queued") is properly adjusted.

Configuration is precise, with no placeholders.

No admin privileges or Docker needed (fully managed via AWS API Gateway and SQS).


‚úÖ Conclusion: High-quality match with OldEpics, no gaps.


---

API-005: GUI Login ‚Üí Cognito OAuth

Assessment:

OAuth flow is identical and well-defined in both Epics.

Clearly specified GUI-to-SQS integration after successful login.

Uses memory-only tokens, safe for your environment.


Potential Issues / Mistakes:

No placeholder detected.

Job enqueue to SQS clearly defined, achievable without Docker/admin rights.


‚úÖ Conclusion: Complete, accurate match to OldEpics. Well defined, improvement evident.


---

‚ë° LAMBDA EPIC Comparison:

LAM-002: SQS Enqueue with Message Attributes

Assessment:

Original Redis enqueue logic fully replaced with correct SQS send_message code.

Message attributes explicitly defined, ensuring rich metadata tracking.


Potential Issues / Mistakes:

SQS visibility timeout (60s) is realistic.

TTL management via SQS retention policy clearly described.

No placeholders detected.

Fully serverless, no Docker/admin rights needed.


‚úÖ Conclusion: Complete replacement; an accurate and detailed enhancement.


---

LAM-003: GPU Cold-Boot Logic with SQS

Assessment:

EC2 cold-start logic correctly adjusted to use SQS instead of Redis.

EC2 start logic properly detailed, realistic, and implementable.

FIFO processing maintained and explained.


Potential Issues / Mistakes:

No placeholders.

Practical, achievable without Docker or admin privileges.

AWS-managed, cost-optimized through serverless SQS and Lambda.


‚úÖ Conclusion: Matches OldEpics detail quality, clearly implementable.


---

LAM-004: SQS Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for Failed Jobs

Assessment:

Explicit DLQ configuration provided.

CloudWatch alarms clearly specified for failure monitoring.

Matches OldEpics' thoroughness in error handling.


Potential Issues / Mistakes:

Config snippet is complete; no placeholders.

Easy integration, achievable without admin rights.


‚úÖ Conclusion: Matches OldEpics‚Äô quality standards completely.


---

‚ë¢ SQS EPIC Audit (newly introduced explicitly):

SQS-001 to SQS-004

Assessment:

Clearly structured for job management, enqueue, visibility timeout, and DLQ.

Properly detailed implementation steps with complete configurations.

FIFO details explicitly defined to ensure correct order.

Dead Letter Queue handling is robust.


Potential Issues / Mistakes:

Fully defined, no placeholders or missing configurations.

Fully AWS-managed; no Docker/admin rights needed.

Greatly reduces cost versus Redis.


‚úÖ Conclusion: High standard; improvement in clarity and cost.


---

‚ë£ EC2 EPIC Comparison:

EC2-001: Shape-Shifting Instance

Assessment:

EC2 resizing logic correctly linked with SQS.

Clear EC2 API calls provided (boto3).

Matches OldEpics detailed style and thoroughness.


Potential Issues / Mistakes:

No placeholders or incomplete links.

Serverless, AWS-managed, no admin needed.


‚úÖ Conclusion: Fully accurate, clear improvement.


---

EC2-002: Admin Resize API

Assessment:

Admin-triggered resize job clearly routed through SQS.

Lambda integration is accurate, complete.


Potential Issues / Mistakes:

No placeholders; realistic and complete.

No local admin rights or Docker dependency.


‚úÖ Conclusion: Accurate and complete; meets OldEpics‚Äô standard.


---

EC2-003: Idle Self-Stop Watchdog

Assessment:

SQS polling clearly replaces Redis job monitoring logic.

Instance stop logic explicit and correct.


Potential Issues / Mistakes:

No placeholders; clear configuration.

Easily implementable, realistic.


‚úÖ Conclusion: Complete, detailed improvement.


---

EC2-004: Docker Builder User-Data Bootstrap

Assessment:

Clearly described EC2 build instance bootstrap script.

Matches OldEpics in completeness.


‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues / Mistakes:

EC2 "user-data" is AWS EC2 cloud feature, not local Docker. However, ensure that build environment explicitly does not require local Docker (it currently does not).


‚úÖ Conclusion: Technically correct; meets rules.


---

‚ë§ CI/CD EPIC Comparison:

CI-001 to CI-004: CI/CD with SQS

Assessment:

Clearly structured CI/CD jobs via SQS FIFO queues.

Clearly defined Lambda logic for sequential job processing.

Complete technical snippets and FIFO management.


Potential Issues / Mistakes:

No placeholder detected.

AWS-managed, no local Docker or admin needed.

Cost effective serverless approach.


‚úÖ Conclusion: Comprehensive and matches OldEpics‚Äô standard.


---

Fully complete and realistic.

No placeholder or incomplete parts.

Managed AWS approach; no Docker/admin needed.


‚úÖ Conclusion: High standard and accurate replacement.


---

‚ë¶ TinyLlama EPIC Comparison (newly structured):
