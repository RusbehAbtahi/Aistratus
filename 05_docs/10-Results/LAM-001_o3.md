# :rocket: LAM-001: Lambda Router Deployment & Integration - Detailed Project Report

## :memo: Executive Summary

This document captures the entire **LAM-001 ticket** process for deploying the **TinyLlama Lambda Router**, covering **JWT authentication**, **JSON schema validation**, **Redis enqueueing**, and **API Gateway integration**. It includes detailed insights into **deployment blockers**, **CI/CD issues**, and **Lambda/TF integration challenges**, with all steps for overcoming these blockers and securing a reliable deployment pipeline.

## :mag_right: **Project Overview & Key Achievements**

### :heavy_check_mark: **Core Objectives Achieved**
- **Lambda Router Deployment**: Full deployment of Lambda Router using **Terraform**, including **JWT and JSON schema validation**.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**: Automated deployment and testing pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to ensure repeatability.
- **Issue Resolution**: Critical issues like **API Gateway mock route** and **stale Lambda deployments** were solved.
- **Performance Enhancements**: Handled **cold start latency**, API integration issues, and environment variable misalignments between CI and local setups.

## :warning: **Key Blockers & Challenges**

### :no_entry_sign: **/ping Route AWS Mock Issue**
- **Problem**: The `/ping` route in **API Gateway** returned a static "Healthy Connection" response, blocking Lambda invocation.
- **Diagnosis**: This was identified as an **AWS reserved route** for internal health checks in HTTP APIs. Attempts to overwrite it failed.
- **Solution**: **Migrated all health checks to `/health`**, which resolved the integration issue and enabled Lambda execution.
- **Lesson**: Never use `/ping` for custom Lambda logic in AWS HTTP APIs, as it is always handled by AWS.

---

### :no_entry_sign: **Lambda Deployment with Terraform**
- **Problem**: Terraform was not detecting code updates to `router.zip` during `terraform apply`, causing Lambda to use outdated code.
- **Diagnosis**: Missing `source_code_hash` in the Lambda resource led to Terraform not recognizing changes.
- **Solution**: Added `source_code_hash = filebase64sha256(...)` and `publish = true` in `main.tf` to ensure code changes were detected and redeployed automatically.
- **Lesson**: Always include `source_code_hash` in Terraform to ensure Lambda code changes are recognized correctly, especially when using deployment artifacts.

---

### :no_entry_sign: **IAM Permissions and Role Management**
- **Problem**: Persistent IAM permission issues, especially `lambda:GetPolicy`, `lambda:UpdateAlias`, and missing CloudWatch permissions, led to frequent deployment failures.
- **Diagnosis**: Missing permissions in the **deployer IAM role** caused incomplete deployments.
- **Solution**: Permissions were **iteratively granted** for **Lambda and CloudWatch actions** based on error messages from each deployment step.
- **Lesson**: **Minimal privilege IAM roles** should be carefully constructed and incrementally extended to avoid permissions drift and untraceable errors.

---

### :no_entry_sign: **CI/CD Testing and Environment Variable Mismatches**
- **Problem**: JWT validation failed in CI due to misalignment of environment variables (`COGNITO_AUD`, `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`) between local and CI environments.
- **Diagnosis**: Test runs were successful locally but failed in CI because **secrets and environment variables** were not properly synchronized.
- **Solution**: Explicitly set environment variables in the **GitHub Actions workflow**, and used the `github_mode` flag in `tools.py` to ensure correct variable handling in CI.
- **Lesson**: Ensure **environment variables are explicitly synced** between CI and local environments, especially for secrets and dynamic parameters.

## :gear: **Technical Insights & Solutions**

### :key: **Terraform and Lambda Packaging**
- **Challenge**: Lambda packaging was inconsistent, causing the Lambda function to be deployed with outdated code.
- **Solution**: Ensured correct packaging by using **`source_code_hash`** in Terraform and **validating against local code**. Lambda deployment was then validated using manual downloads and S3 tests.
- **Lesson**: Always verify **Lambda artifact integrity** after each deploy, using Terraformâ€™s `source_code_hash` for detection.

---

### :lock: **AWS IAM & Permissions Management**
- **Challenge**: IAM policies had to be adjusted for each step of the deployment to grant the required permissions for Lambda functions and CloudWatch integration.
- **Solution**: **Iterative IAM policy refinement** was performed by analyzing AWS errors and granting precise permissions only after errors surfaced.
- **Lesson**: When debugging IAM errors, ensure that **permissions are granted just-in-time** (minimal privilege) and always review AWS error messages for the exact missing permission.

---

### :zap: **JWT & Schema Validation**
- **Challenge**: Ensuring the **Lambda Router** validated JWT tokens and schema before processing requests.
- **Solution**: Leveraged **Pydantic** for JSON schema validation and ensured **JWT verification** was robust, handling both invalid and expired tokens appropriately.
- **Lesson**: Use **Pydantic** for data validation in production-level Lambda functions to guarantee correct input and failure handling.

---

### :wrench: **CI/CD Pipeline Debugging**
- **Challenge**: CI/CD pipeline failures due to **JWT audience mismatch** and **environment variables not being correctly set**.
- **Solution**: Explicitly set **Cognito variables** in the CI/CD workflow and ensured **secrets and env-vars** aligned in both CI and local environments.
- **Lesson**: **Environment variables management** must be a first-class concern in CI/CD pipelines to avoid divergence in development workflows.

## :pushpin: **Future Improvements & Outstanding Work**

### :stopwatch: **Lambda Cold Start Mitigation**
- **Next Steps**: Explore using **Lambda warmers** or **scheduled events** to reduce **cold-start latency** for improved API response times.
  
### :bangbang: **SSM Parameter Management**
- **Next Steps**: Ensure that **SSM parameters** (like the API Gateway URL) are correctly propagated after each **Terraform `apply`** to avoid misconfigurations or stale parameters.

### :exclamation: **API Gateway Integration**
- **Next Steps**: Double-check that **API Gateway routes** are properly wired through Terraform to avoid manual overrides and ensure consistent deployment across environments.

## :bookmark_tabs: **Lessons Learned**

- **Environment Variable Sync**: Ensure environment variables are **properly set and synced** between local and CI environments.
- **IAM Policies**: Follow the **minimal privilege** principle for IAM roles and update them incrementally as needed.
- **Lambda Artifact Management**: Always include **`source_code_hash`** in Terraform to track code changes.
- **No Overwrites on Reserved Routes**: Avoid using `/ping` for user-facing Lambda functions in AWS HTTP APIs.
