# üöÄ **LAM-001: Lambda Router Deployment & Integration - Comprehensive Technical Report**

---

## üìå **1. Project Overview**

This document details the complete lifecycle, critical challenges, technical insights, and final state of the **LAM-001 Ticket (Lambda Router Integration)** within the TinnyLlama Project, emphasizing JWT validation, JSON schema validation, Redis enqueue logic, Terraform-based deployment, and comprehensive CI/CD automation.

---

## üéØ **2. Key Objectives Achieved**

* ‚úÖ **Lambda Router Fully Deployed** via Terraform with robust JWT validation and JSON schema checks.
* ‚úÖ **Fully Integrated CI/CD Pipeline** leveraging GitHub Actions for consistent deployments.
* ‚úÖ **Resolved AWS-specific route issues** (`/ping` route reservation) and Lambda deployment anomalies.
* ‚úÖ **Established Scalable Environment Management** for syncing local and CI environments.

---

## üöß **3. Deep Dive: Major Technical Blockers & Solutions**

---

### ‚õî **3.1 AWS Reserved `/ping` Route Conflict**

**Issue**:
The `/ping` endpoint on AWS API Gateway HTTP APIs was reserved by AWS, returning a static mock response. Extensive debugging (multiple days) proved no method could overwrite this behavior.

**Resolution**:
Switched to a custom `/health` route, instantly resolving the issue.

**Technical Tricks & Lessons**:

* Always verify reserved routes in AWS documentation before implementation.
* Implement immediate route validation post-setup to detect reservation conflicts early.

---

### ‚õî **3.2 Lambda Deployment: Terraform & `source_code_hash`**

**Issue**:
Terraform failed to detect and update the deployed Lambda function (`router.zip`). This caused stale code deployment, unnoticed until detailed hash comparison.

**Resolution**:
Added `source_code_hash = filebase64sha256(...)` and enabled `publish = true` in Terraform.

**Technical Tricks & Lessons**:

* Always include `source_code_hash` when deploying Lambda functions via Terraform to ensure accurate change detection.
* Use shell scripts (`aws lambda get-function`) to verify Lambda deployments by hash comparison post-deploy.

```hcl
resource "aws_lambda_function" "router" {
  filename         = "router.zip"
  source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("router.zip")
  publish          = true
  // other config...
}
```

---

### ‚õî **3.3 IAM Permission Iterative Debugging**

**Issue**:
Deployment repeatedly failed due to IAM permission errors (`lambda:GetPolicy`, `lambda:UpdateAlias`, `lambda:PublishVersion`). Errors surfaced incrementally, complicating rapid iteration.

**Resolution**:
Iteratively refined IAM policies based strictly on AWS error feedback, granting minimal, just-in-time permissions.

**Technical Tricks & Lessons**:

* Ensure IAM policies explicitly include required actions only, avoiding overly broad wildcards (`*`).
* Always debug IAM by directly inspecting AWS CloudTrail or CLI errors rather than speculating.

Example IAM snippet added:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "lambda:GetPolicy",
    "lambda:UpdateAlias",
    "lambda:PublishVersion"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:<region>:<account-id>:function:tlfif-default-router:*"
}
```

---

### ‚õî **3.4 CI/CD Environment Variables & JWT Debugging**

**Issue**:
JWT token validation failed in CI (403 Invalid Audience) due to mismatches between local and CI environment variables (`COGNITO_AUD`, `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`).

**Resolution**:
Explicitly set Cognito environment variables within GitHub Actions workflows, aligning secrets between local and CI environments. Introduced `github_mode` flag to differentiate environment variable management in local versus CI workflows.

**Technical Tricks & Lessons**:

* Avoid discrepancies by explicitly setting and verifying environment variables at the CI configuration stage.
* Introduce environment-specific flags (e.g., `github_mode`) in deployment scripts to isolate local/CI logic cleanly.

Example CI workflow snippet:

```yaml
env:
  COGNITO_AUD: ${{ secrets.COGNITO_AUD }}
  COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID: ${{ secrets.COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID }}
```

---

### ‚õî **3.5 SSM Parameter Synchronization**

**Issue**:
SSM parameters (API Gateway URLs, Cognito IDs) frequently became outdated after Terraform cycles (`destroy`/`apply`), causing stale references and test failures.

**Resolution**:
Implemented automatic rewrite of `.env_public` file after each Terraform run, dynamically fetching latest outputs (SSM/Cognito IDs) from Terraform state.

**Technical Tricks & Lessons**:

* Automate environment variable synchronization via Python scripts immediately post-Terraform apply.
* Include state-dependent parameters in `.env_public` with documented auto-update mechanisms.

## üõ†Ô∏è **4. Detailed Technical Insights**

---

### üß© **Lambda Cold-Start Performance**

* **Issue**: Lambda cold-start latency impacted response times significantly.
* **Future Steps**: Planning to introduce Lambda warmers or scheduled pings to pre-warm Lambda functions, ensuring consistent response times.

---

### üîê **JWT & Schema Validation Robustness**

* JWT validation leveraged canonical helper (`verify_jwt`) and Pydantic models for schema enforcement, ensuring runtime validation and precise error messaging.
* Ensured correct exception handling (`ExpiredSignatureError` vs `InvalidSignatureError`) to return accurate HTTP codes (401 vs 403).

---

### üì¶ **Lambda Layer & File System Handling**

* Encountered file system errors due to read-only Lambda environments (`[Errno 30]`).
* Solution: Ensured unconditional use of `/tmp` directory (`mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`) for temporary data storage in Lambda.
