## :memo: **Executive Summary**

This document details the **LAM-001 ticket** process for deploying the **TinyLlama Lambda Router**, focusing on **JWT authentication**, **JSON schema validation**, **Redis enqueueing**, and **API Gateway integration**. The report provides insights into the **major deployment blockers**, **CI/CD issues**, **IAM integration challenges**, and steps taken to overcome them. 

Key achievements:
- Full **Lambda Router deployment** via **Terraform**.
- **JWT validation** and **schema checks** successfully integrated.
- **Critical CI/CD and IAM issues** resolved, ensuring reproducible deployments.
- **API Gateway** route issues addressed, transitioning from AWS‚Äôs `/ping` to custom `/health`.

---

## :mag_right: **Key Achievements and Resolutions**

### :heavy_check_mark: **Core Objectives**
- **Lambda Router Deployment**: Full deployment and validation using **Terraform**, integrating **JWT and JSON schema validation**.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment using **GitHub Actions** for consistent, repeatable tests and deployment.
- **Issue Resolution**: Successfully resolved AWS `/ping` mock route problem and stale Lambda deployments.

---

## :warning: **Key Blockers & Challenges**

### :no_entry_sign: **/ping Route AWS Mock Issue**
- **Problem**: The `/ping` endpoint was reserved by AWS and returned a **static "Healthy Connection"** mock response, blocking Lambda execution.
- **Diagnosis**: `/ping` is an **AWS-reserved route** for internal health checks in HTTP APIs, making it impossible to use for custom Lambda integration.
- **Solution**: Migrated all health checks to the **`/health`** route, which resolved the integration issue and successfully invoked Lambda.
- **Lesson**: **Never use `/ping`** for Lambda functions in AWS HTTP APIs as it‚Äôs reserved for internal health checks.

### :no_entry_sign: **Lambda Deployment & Source Code Hash Issue**
- **Problem**: Terraform was not detecting changes to `router.zip`, causing Lambda to use outdated code even after `terraform apply`.
- **Diagnosis**: The **`source_code_hash`** field was missing, preventing Terraform from detecting and deploying code updates.
- **Solution**: Added `source_code_hash = filebase64sha256(...)` and set `publish = true` in `main.tf` to ensure code updates were tracked and redeployed automatically.
- **Lesson**: Always include **`source_code_hash`** in Terraform-managed Lambda functions to track and deploy code updates correctly.

### :no_entry_sign: **IAM Permissions Issues**
- **Problem**: Frequent **IAM permission errors** (e.g., `lambda:GetPolicy`, `lambda:UpdateAlias`) during deployment.
- **Diagnosis**: Missing permissions for Lambda and CloudWatch actions, which were uncovered incrementally during deployment.
- **Solution**: **Iteratively refined IAM policies**, ensuring minimal, just-in-time permissions based on specific AWS error outputs.
- **Lesson**: Use **least privilege** for IAM roles and grant only the permissions necessary at each deployment step.

### :no_entry_sign: **CI/CD Testing & Environment Variable Mismatch**
- **Problem**: CI tests failed due to mismatches in environment variables (`COGNITO_AUD`, `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`) between local and CI environments.
- **Diagnosis**: Local runs used hardcoded or fallback values for environment variables, while CI used dynamically injected secrets that sometimes lagged behind recent changes.
- **Solution**: Explicitly set **Cognito environment variables** in the **GitHub Actions workflow** and introduced a `github_mode` flag in `tools.py` to sync local and CI variables.
- **Lesson**: Ensure **explicit synchronization of environment variables** between local and CI environments, especially when using secrets.

---

## :gear: **Technical Insights & Solutions**

### :key: **Terraform & Lambda Packaging**
- **Challenge**: Lambda was deploying stale code due to Terraform failing to detect changes.
- **Solution**: Correct packaging using `source_code_hash` ensured accurate tracking of deployment artifacts. Manual S3 and AWS Lambda downloads were used to verify the deployment integrity.
- **Lesson**: **Verify Lambda artifact integrity** by using `source_code_hash` in Terraform for code updates.

### :lock: **IAM Role and Permissions Management**
- **Challenge**: **IAM policy debugging** led to a slow, iterative process of granting the correct permissions for Lambda and CloudWatch integration.
- **Solution**: Permissions were updated incrementally based on specific AWS error messages, ensuring only necessary actions were granted.
- **Lesson**: **IAM permissions should be updated just-in-time** and always reviewed based on error messages to avoid excessive privileges.

### :zap: **JWT & Schema Validation**
- **Challenge**: Ensuring **JWT validation** and **schema checks** were robust, validating both invalid and expired tokens properly.
- **Solution**: Leveraged **Pydantic** for schema validation and a shared JWT utility to check token validity.
- **Lesson**: **Pydantic** ensures efficient runtime data validation and clear failure handling, crucial for production-level Lambda functions.

## :pushpin: **Future Improvements & Outstanding Tasks**

### :stopwatch: **Lambda Cold Start Mitigation**
- **Next Steps**: Implement **Lambda warmers** or **scheduled pings** to mitigate **cold start latency**, improving response time for API Gateway requests.

### :bangbang: **SSM Parameter Management**
- **Next Steps**: Improve **SSM parameter synchronization** to ensure parameters like **API Gateway URLs** and **Cognito IDs** are always up-to-date after each **Terraform apply**.

### :exclamation: **API Gateway Integration**
- **Next Steps**: Double-check that **API Gateway routes** are properly managed through **Terraform** to avoid future manual overrides and ensure consistent deployment.

---

## :bookmark_tabs: **Lessons Learned**

- **Environment Variable Sync**: Always ensure **proper environment variable sync** between local and CI environments.
- **IAM Policies**: Follow **least privilege** IAM role principles, granting permissions only as needed.
- **Lambda Deployment**: Use **`source_code_hash`** to track Lambda code changes in Terraform deployments.
- **Route and API Setup**: Avoid using AWS-reserved routes like `/ping` and always verify custom route integration early.

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Terraform**        | ‚Ä¢ Added `var.env`  <br>‚Ä¢ `locals_ids.tf` maps every ID ‚Üí SSM path  <br>‚Ä¢ New module `10_global_backend/modules/ssm_params` writes parameters  <br>‚Ä¢ Workspace-agnostic **read-back** via `data "aws_ssm_parameter"` |

## üèÜ Motivation

* **One source of truth.** No more hard-coded ARNs in code, CI, or TF outputs.
* **Workspace isolation.** Switching `.env_public ‚Üí dev` spins an entirely separate stack without resource collisions.
* **Zero manual sync.** CI detects the active env, pulls the correct IDs, and ‚Äújust works‚Äù.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works (high-level)

1. **Plan/apply** in any TF workspace writes its real IDs to
   `/tinyllama/<env>/<key>` in SSM.
2. **Runtime / tests** call `get_id("vpc_id")` ‚Üí cached SSM read.
3. **CI** job first loads `.env_public`, then injects the same IDs into env-vars for Postman + pytest.

**STATUS: CLOSED** ‚Äî *01.07.2025*


**Pull Request Description: Infra-001 ‚Äî AWS Networking Baseline**

This PR implements the complete baseline AWS network infrastructure for the TinnyLlama project using Terraform. All resources are reproducibly managed as code and designed for cost efficiency and security.

**Included in this PR:**

* Creation of a dedicated S3 bucket (`tinnyllama-terraform-state`) and DynamoDB table for remote Terraform state and locking (in `terraform/00_bootstrap_state`).
* Provisioning of a custom VPC (`10.20.0.0/22`), one public subnet, and two private subnets.
* Deployment of an Internet Gateway for public connectivity.
* Route tables and associations for correct traffic routing across all subnets.
* Optional NAT-Gateway and Elastic IP, controlled by a single `enable_nat_gw` variable (default: `false`). These high-cost resources are only created when explicitly needed, and can be destroyed by toggling the variable and reapplying.
* All project networking code is tracked, versioned, and follows professional Terraform repo standards, with all state/cache files ignored via `.gitignore`.

**Instructions:**

* Reviewers can inspect all `.tf` code and verify that no `.terraform/` or state files are present in the repo.
* This PR is the foundation for all further TinnyLlama infrastructure and future application epics.


# üöÄüöÄüöÄ **‚ú® API-002: JWT Authorizer & /infer Route ‚Äì Implementation Summary** üöÄüöÄüöÄ

**STATUS: CLOSED** ‚Äî 26.06.2025*

## Overview

This pull request fully implements **API-002**, adding robust JWT-based authorization and an authenticated `/infer` endpoint to the TinyLlama Edge API.  
The ticket closes a major architectural milestone by ensuring that all inference routes can be securely protected using standard AWS Cognito-compatible JWT tokens‚Äîmirroring production identity, but enabling deterministic, reproducible tests for rapid development.

---

## Scope of Work

- **Promoted `jwt_tools.py`**  
  The helper for generating and verifying test tokens was moved into the application package (`tinyllama.utils`) and refactored for seamless local, test, and CI usage.
- **Lazy JWKS Reload & Raw-Dict Decoding**  
  The authorizer now loads JWKS from disk or Cognito dynamically and avoids `jwk.construct`, fixing compatibility with both Python-Jose and fast local key-rotation.
- **Consistent Environment Setup**  
  Root-level `conftest.py` injects local JWKS and Cognito App Client ID, ensuring tests and local runs always use the intended configuration.
- **Stubbed `/infer` Endpoint**  
  The POST `/infer` endpoint is now present and protected by the JWT verifier; it will be connected to real inference logic in the next sprint.
- **Green Tests & Stable CI**  
  Six exhaustive unit/integration tests cover all happy and error paths for JWT validation, including bad signature, expired, missing, and audience-mismatch scenarios.
- **Dev and CI Environment**  
  All Python dependencies (FastAPI, Python-Jose, Cryptography, Pydantic v2, Uvicorn, Requests, HTTPX, Pydantic-Settings, Python-Dotenv, Pytest) are now version-locked in `requirements.txt` and mirrored in `setup.py`.  
  CI was debugged to green with deterministic install steps.
- **`.env.dev` Support**  
  A `.env.dev` file at project root lets developers run the API locally without needing to manually export env vars every session.

---

## Major Challenges (and Solutions)

- **Pytest Path Problems:**  
  Local test helpers (`jwt_tools.py`) were initially not importable due to Python path isolation. This was resolved by promoting helpers to the real package and aligning imports project-wide.
- **JWKS Loading Race:**  
  The initial JWKS cache loaded too early, missing test keys and causing 403s on valid tokens. A new lazy-reload approach guarantees the key is always up-to-date for tests and local runs.
- **Audience Mismatch:**  
  Tokens in tests defaulted to `"dummy-aud"`, but the app enforced the real Cognito client ID. Both test and app now use the same, single source of truth.
- **"Unknown kid" in Local Uvicorn:**  
  The dev server, when run outside Pytest, was not picking up local keys, returning 403. This was resolved by introducing `.env.dev` and python-dotenv to auto-inject local JWKS and App Client ID for all dev runs.
- **Missing Dev Tools in CI:**  
  Pytest was briefly omitted from `requirements.txt` and caused a GitHub Actions failure. The list was fixed, and all CI runs now reproduce the local dev experience.

---

## Tools & Workflow

- **Python:** 3.10 locally, 3.11 in CI
- **FastAPI** for app routes and dependency injection
- **Pytest** for test discovery and assertion
- **Python-Jose** and **Cryptography** for JWT signing/verification
- **Requests** and **HTTPX** for local and test HTTP calls
- **Uvicorn** for local ASGI development server
- **Pydantic v2** and **pydantic-settings** for modern settings management
- **Python-Dotenv** for local dev config
- **Postman & Newman** for manual and automated API contract testing (collections included)
- **GitHub Actions** for CI
- **Markdown** and clear commit messages for traceable history

---

## Usage

**To run locally:**
1. Activate your venv and install deps (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
2. Copy `.env.dev` to the project root (see template).
3. Start the server:  
   `uvicorn api.routes:app --reload`
4. Generate a JWT:  
   `python -c "from tinyllama.utils.jwt_tools import make_token; print(make_token(aud='<client-id>'))"`
5. Call `/infer` with that token via Postman, Curl, or Python requests.

---

## Next Steps

- Replace the `/infer` stub with the real model inference call.
- Expand test coverage for payload validation and backend error handling.
- Parameterize dev/test JWT keys and add rotation hooks if needed.
- Document the full deployment flow and automate secrets rotation.

**STATUS: CLOSED** ‚Äî 18.06.2025*



This PR completes Epic GUI-007 by refactoring the TinyLlama Desktop codebase into a professional, modular MVC + Services architecture. All legacy monolithic files and obsolete tests have been removed. The project is now split into clean, testable modules: pure Tkinter view, dedicated controllers (Prompt, GPU, Cost, Auth), AppState, and ThreadService.
All code is under 80 LOC per file with single responsibility. A complete suite of 8 unit-tested modules replaces previous fragile tests.
Key changes include:

Modularization of all business logic‚Äîno more mixed UI/business code
Fully passing, audited pytest suite (8 pairs: controllers, view, state, service)
Updated sequence diagrams and architecture docs
Removal of deprecated/obsolete test files and legacy diagrams
All requirements in GUI-007 met: UX parity, threading safety, architecture clarity, and test green
Ready for integration with AWS backend and future cloud Epics
Closes: #<Epic_number_for_GUI-007>
Reviewers: Please check that new file layout, controller/view separation, and test coverage meet the requirements in the Epic and attached UML.
